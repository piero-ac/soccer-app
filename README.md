# Soccer App

Made using Vite, React, and Bootstrap 5.

## Leagues

Users can view table, match, and top scorers information for the following leagues:

<ul>
<li> Bundesliga</li>
<li> La Liga</li>
<li> Ligue 1</li>
<li> Premier League</li>
<li> Serie A</li>
</ul>

## Season

Users can view information for the 2020, 2021, and 2022 seasons.

## Description

I wanted to remake my project from my senior capstone class using React.
So far, users can view information for completed seasons and cannot view live updates of soccer matches.
